have you ever been having a great day having fun feeling good cruising along when someone or something bugs you out of the blue what do you choose to do you snap back and take the bait like a seriously stressed out fish on a hook or do you make a different choice are you more like this thoughtful fish who didn't take the bait and just swam along having fun feeling just fine so next time something doesn't go your way and you have a stressful feeling remember you have a choice You don't have to snap and react without thinking will you let stress hook you or refuse to take the bait it's up to you
